# priority-queue
Implement a priority queue using a dynamic array that doubles in size when the queue is full and shrinks so the array size is never 3 times the number of elements.  The array should only contain PriorityItem objects.  A priority object should have an int member variable that represents the priority and a generic member variable that contains the data of the item.
